# security-camera_repair
Hello!! Today I am repairing a security camera! 
All I know about the camera is that it's from Temu :O! So yes, the quality is not the best! 
The PCB quality is actually very good and looks well designed!

Also there are 7 capacitors that don't work! I guess maybe there is some other reason why they are not working!


(P.S. I am going to fix it soon! My older brother is going to give me hot head gun soon! So yea I am going to change capacitors soon!!!)
